========================

This is a client library written in Java enabling a connection to a MasterVolt inverter.

Credits & thanks go to:

- Marco Bakker http://zon.mbsoft.nl - editor of a bash script

The library connects to a RS-485-to-TCP/IP converter like the ATC-1000.

The code is tested with a MasterVolt XS3200 inverter.

Feel free to fork and improve the code!
